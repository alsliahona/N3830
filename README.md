Reference Implementation of C++ ISO LEWG N3830 scoped_resource.h

scoped_resource.h is the reference implementation of scoped_resource as
presented in the C++ ISO Committee Document N3830 from pre-Issaquah 2014
mailings.

hello.cpp is a simple example that was tested on Ubutu Linux using
recent clang code that supports C++14 (C++1y).

scoped_resource was implemented by Peter Sommerlad in response to the
N3677 classes presented to the C++ ISO LEWG Committee by Andrew L. Sandoval.

This implementation is only slightly altered from the reference and documented
version to enhance readability (for me anyway).
